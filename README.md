<h1>Visualizing Olympics Performance</h1>

Problem Statement: Visualizing Olympic performance, by country, from 1960 to 2016 and its correlation with various indirect affecting parameters over the years.


Description: We aim to investigate factors involved in the performances of athletes and countries as a whole to pinpoint how individuals and groups can improve. We also plan on looking at any other potential factors (GDP, Life expectancy, etc.) that do not essentially play a direct role in affecting performances. There are many other factors outside of the anatomy of an athlete that might affect how well a country performs at the Olympics. These might include the total population, what income group the country is a part of, how big the economy is, and so on. There is also the potential to figure out whether some popular sports are dominated by certain age groups and genders.

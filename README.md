<h1>Predicting Medical Score</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>The challenge involves predicting the medical score of patients using the provided dataset and determining the variables with the highest predictive power.


<h2>Description:</h2>The following project will aim to study the medical condition of a patient and predict medical scores using a model trained on the data provided. Initially, I worked on studying the dataset and trying to figure out which features are the most relevant to the medical score. I then proceeded to work with a few machine learning models to determine which model works best. The primary performance metric I used to evaluate the models is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Getting a lower RMSE also involved a lot of trial & error in trying to figure out which variables are significant. Once I had chosen the best working model, I then generated predictions for the test data provided.
